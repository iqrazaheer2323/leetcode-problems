# 🧠 Daily LeetCode Practice

Welcome to my **Daily LeetCode Practice Repository**!  
This repo is my personal commitment to improve problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews through consistent practice on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

## 🚀 Goal

Solve at least **one LeetCode problem every day**, and upload the solution here with proper structure and explanations (if necessary). This habit helps build consistency, strengthen DSA concepts, and get better prepared for placement interviews and coding competitions.
